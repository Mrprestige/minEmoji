#jMinEmoji2
Please don't hate me, I know this is in bower, I know I could just upgrade the darn script, BUT...
There are so many different things to take into consideretion, heare a few of them:

1. The sprite has incresed it's size from 515Kb (527865) to 780Kb (799075), that is 1.51x from the original, I don't know how practical is the idea of using a sprite when it becomes a huge file.

2. There are no other options to the extracted Apple PNGs, [twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) hasn't created all SVGs for the new emojis (no update for jMinEmoji-SVG) and the Chrome extension where I extracted all Google emojis hasn't ben updated since October 8, 2013. All this left us with only one sprite, only one emoji style.

**Conclusion**: Waiting for others sources is silly, I don't want to wait for others and I want a JS library that can handle new emojis, so if I can't upgrade my scripts the only solution is to create a different version.

Do you agree with me? if not, support the project by submitting new sources for the Twitter and Android emojis.
