Hi, I hope this library help you, I added a new folder just for iOS 10 / macOS 10.12, please, don’t be angry at me for doing so, I really want to have a full stack of emojis from different providers, but most of them don’t have an up to date emoji file asset, as always, Apple is the first one to release new additions.

I’m NOT following any Unicode table or standard, my reasons for doing things this way is simple, if the emoji doesn’t exist in an Apple (software) keyboard, it doesn’t exist in any other form on the internet, I only include emojis that can be typed using an iOS or macOS (software) keyboard, I also check against the images that can be extracted from the Apple font file, just to corroborate that all emojis that can be typed on any Apple device have an image that matches in the font.

I’m only updating this (Apple) version because it took months for Twemoji to update their repo and with the latest Apple emojis it is outdated, Google hasn’t an up to date repo for years, the only ones that I know are always working on new additions are Emoji One and they already have their own code.

And that is only the sources, I do this code because I love code and I love emojis, it takes time to extract the images from the Apple font and to be identified by hand one by one, time I give for free to you, but I also need to pay my bills and do tons of (not quite well paid) work, I’m not selling shirts or doing anything outside coding.

But hey, this is the internet, if you want to help to this repo you can donate to the cause:

Again, I hope you like the code and understand my reasons.
