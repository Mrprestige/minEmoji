# ALPHA
This is an early development for the new minEmoji version supporting new emojis, diversity and extra emojis, the current problem resides in the lack of extra emojis from other sources, the only source available is “Apple Color Emoji.ttf”, twemoji is lacking new images and there is no new emojis from Google, so I’m stuck with Apple’s PNGs as the only option.

The second problem is that 1,363 emojis make the idea of using a PNG sprite obsolete, it is too much data to load a single emoji, so it is better to load each image separately.

This two issues make hard to “upgrade” all the libraries for now, I guess time will tell what to do next, but you can clone this alpha version and adapt it to your work.
